<p>"The architectural spirit which has arisen in London since the
late peace, and ramified from thence to every city and town of the
empire, will present an era in our domestic history." Such is the
opinion of an intelligent writer in a recent number of Brande's
"Quarterly Journal;" and he goes on to describe the new erections
in the Regent's Park as the "dawning of a new and better taste, and
in comparison with that which preceded it, a just subject of
national exultation;" in illustration of which fact we have
selected the subjoined view of <i>Hanover Terrace</i>, being the
last group on the left of the York-gate entrance, and that next
beyond Sussex-place, distinguishable by its cupola tops.</p>
<p>Hanover Terrace, unlike Cornwall and other terraces of the
Regent's Park, is somewhat raised from the level of the road, and
fronted by a shrubbery, through which is a carriage-drive. The
general effect of the terrace is pleasing; and the pediments,
supported on an arched rustic basement by fluted Doric columns, are
full of richness and chaste design; the centre representing an
emblematical group of the arts and sciences, the two ends being
occupied with antique devices; and the three surmounted with
figures of the Muses. The frieze is also light and simply elegant.
The architect is Mr. Nash, to whose classic taste the Regent's Park
is likewise indebted for other interesting architectural
groups.</p>
<p>Altogether, Hanover Terrace may be considered as one of the most
splendid works of the neighbourhood, and it is alike characteristic
of British opulence, and of the progressive improvement of national
taste. On the general merits of these erections we shall avail
ourselves of the author already quoted, inasmuch as his remarks are
uniformly distinguished by moderation and good taste.</p>
<p>"Regent's Park, and its circumjacent buildings, promise, in few
years, to afford something like an equipoise to the boasted
<i>Palace-group</i> of Paris. If the plan already acted upon is
steadily pursued, it will present a union of rural and
architectural beauty on a scale of greater magnificence than can be
found in any other place. The variety is here in the detached
groups, and not as formerly in the individual dwellings, by which
all unity and grandeur of effect was, of course, annihilated. These
groups, undoubtedly, will not always bear the eye of a severe
critic, but altogether they exhibit, perhaps, as much beauty as can
easily be introduced into a collection of dwelling-houses of
moderate size. Great care has been, taken to give something of a
classical air to every composition; and with this object, the
deformity of <i>door-cases</i> has been in most cases excluded, and
the entrances made from behind. The Doric and Ionic orders have
been chiefly employed; but the Corinthian, and even the Tuscan, are
occasionally introduced. One of these groups is finished with
domes; but this is an attempt at magnificence which, on so small a
scale, is not deserving of imitation."</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>SIR,&mdash;Under the <i>Arcana of Science</i>, in your last
Number, I observed an account of the inroads made by the sea on the
Isle of Sheppey, together with the exhumation there of numerous
animal and vegetable remains. As an additional fact I inform you,
that, at about three hundred feet below the surface of the
sand-bank, (of which the island is composed,) there is a vast
prostrate antediluvian forest, masses of which are being
continually developed by the influence of marine agency, and
exhibit highly singular appearances. When the workmen were employed
some years back in sinking a well to supply the garrison with
water, the aid of gunpowder was required to blast the fossil
timber, it having attained, by elementary action and the repose of
ages, the hard compactness of rock or granite stone. Aquatic
productions also appear to observation in their natural shape and
proportion, with the advantage of high preservation, to facilitate
the study of the inquiring philosopher. I have seen entire
lobsters, eels, crabs, &amp;c. all transformed into perfect
lapidifications. Many of these interesting bodies have been
selected, and at the present time tend to enrich the elaborate
collections of the Museum of London and the Institute of France.
During the winter of 1825, in examining a piece of petrified wood,
which I had picked up on the shore, we discovered a very minute
aperture, barely the size of a pin-hole, and on breaking the
substance by means of a large hammer, to our surprise and regret we
crushed a small reptile that was concealed inside, and which, in
consequence, we were unfortunately prevented from restoring to its
original shape. The body was of a circular shape and iron coloured;
but from the blood which slightly moistened the face of the
instrument, we were satisfied it must have been animated. I showed
the fragments of both to a gentleman in the island, who, like
myself, lamented the accident, as it had, in all likelihood,
deprived science of forming some valuable <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span>
(perhaps) deductions on this incarcerated, or (if I may be allowed
the expression) compound phenomenon. I have merely related the
above incident in order to show the possibility of there being
other creatures accessible to discovery under similar
circumstances, and in their nature, perhaps homogeneous. I left the
island next day, and therefore had no further opportunities of
confirming such an opinion; but the place itself abounds with
substances which would authorize such conjectures.</p>

<h3>CARRYING THE TAR BARRELS AT BROUGH, WESTMORELAND.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>SIR,&mdash;In the haste in which I wrote my last account of the
carrying of "tar barrels" in Westmoreland,<a id="footnotetag14"
name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>
(owing to the pressure of time,) I omitted some most interesting
information, and I think I cannot do better than supply the
deficiency this year.</p>
<p>As I said before, the day is prepared for, about a month
previously&mdash;the townsmen employ themselves in hagging furze
for the "bon-fire," which is situated in an adjoining field.
Another party go round to the different houses, grotesquely
attired, supplicating contributions for the "tar barrels," and at
each house, after receiving a donation, chant a few doggerel verses
and huzza! It is, however, well that people should contribute
towards defraying the expense, for if they do not get enough money
they commit sad depredations, and if any one is seen carrying a
barrel they wrest it from him.</p>
<p>For my part, I liked the "watch night" the best, and if it were
possible to keep sober, one might enjoy the fun&mdash;sad havoc
indeed was then made among the poultry&mdash;when ducks and fowls
were crackling before the fire all night; in fact, a few previous
days were regular shooting days, and the little birds were killed
by scores. But ere morning broke in upon them, many of the merry
group were lying in a beastly state under the chairs and tables, or
others had gone to bed; but this is what <i>they</i> called
spending a <i>merry night</i>. The day arrives, and a whole troop
of temporary soldiers assemble in the town at 10 P.M. with their
borrowed instruments and dresses, and <i>a real Guy</i>,&mdash;not
a <i>paper one</i>,&mdash;but a <i>living one</i>&mdash;a regular
painted old fellow, I assure you, with a pair of boots like the
Ogre's seven leagued, seated on an ass, with the mob continually
bawling out, "there's a <i>par</i> o'ye!"</p>
<p>Thus they parade the town&mdash;one of the head leaders knocks
at the door&mdash;repeats the customary verses, while the other
holds a silken purse for the cash, which they divide amongst them
after the expenses are paid&mdash;and a pretty full purse they get
too. In the evening so anxious are they to fire the stack, that
lanterns may be seen glimmering in all parts of the field like so
many will-o'-the-wisps; then follow the tar barrels, and after this
boisterous amusement the scene closes, save the noise throughout
the night, and for some nights after of the drunken people, who
very often repent their folly by losing their situations.</p>
<p>Now, respecting the origin of this custom, I merely, by way of
hint, submit, that in the time of Christian martyrdom, as tar
barrels were used for the "burning at the stake" to increase the
ravages of the flame:&mdash;the custom is derived,&mdash;out of
rejoicings for the abolition of the horrid practice, and this they
show by carrying them on their heads (as represented at page 296,
vol. 8.), but you may treat this suggestion as you please, and
perhaps have the kindness to substitute your own, or inquire into
it.</p>

<h3>CUSTOM OF BAKING SOUR CAKES.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>Rutherglen, in the county of Lanarkshire, has long been famous
for the singular custom of baking what are called sour cakes. About
eight or ten days before St. Luke's fair (for they are baked at no
other time in the year), a certain quantity of oatmeal is made into
dough with warm water, and laid up in a vessel to ferment. Being
brought to a proper degree of fermentation and consistency, it is
rolled up into balls proportionable to the intended largeness of
the cakes. With the dough is commonly mixed a small quantity of
sugar, and a little aniseed or cinnamon. The baking is executed by
women only; and they seldom begin their work till after sunset, and
a night or two before the fair. A large space of the house, chosen
for the purpose, is marked out by a line drawn upon it. The area
within is considered as consecrated ground, and is not, by any of
the bystanders, to be touched with impunity. The transgression
incurs a small fine, which is always laid out in drink for the use
of the company. This hallowed spot, is occupied by six or eight
women, all of whom, except the toaster, seat themselves on the
ground, in a circular form, having their feet turned towards the
fire. Each of them is provided with a bakeboard about two feet
square, which they hold on their knees. The woman who toasts the
cakes, which is done on an iron plate suspended over the fire, is
called the queen, or bride, and the rest are called her maidens.
These are distinguished from one another by names given them for
the occasion. She who sits next the fire, towards the east, is
called the todler; her companion on the left hand is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg
317]</span> the trodler;<a id="footnotetag15" name=
"footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the
rest have arbitrary names given them by the bride, as Mrs. Baker,
best and worst maids, &amp;c. The operation is begun by the todler,
who takes a ball of the dough, forms it into a cake, and then casts
it on the bakeboard of the trodler, who beats it out a little
thinner. This being done, she, in her turn, throws it on the board
of her neighbour; and thus it goes round, from east to west, in the
direction of the course of the sun, until it comes to the toaster,
by which time it is as thin and smooth as a sheet of paper. The
first cake that is cast on the girdle is usually named as a gift to
some man who is known to have suffered from the infidelity of his
wife, from a superstitious notion, that thereby the rest will be
preserved from mischance. Sometimes the cake is so thin, as to be
carried by the current of the air up into the chimney. As the
baking is wholly performed by the hand, a great deal of noise is
the consequence. The beats, however, are not irregular, nor
destitute of an agreeable harmony, especially when they are
accompanied with vocal music, which is frequently the case. Great
dexterity is necessary, not only to beat out the cakes with no
other instrument than the hand, so that no part of them shall be
thicker than another, but especially to cast them from one board to
another without ruffling or breaking them. The toasting requires
considerable skill; for which reason the most experienced person in
the company is chosen for that part of the work. One cake is sent
round in quick succession to another, so that none of the company
is suffered to be idle. The whole is a scene of activity, mirth,
and diversion. As there is no account, even by tradition itself,
concerning the origin of this custom, it must be very ancient. The
bread thus baked was, doubtless, never intended for common use. It
is not easy to conceive how mankind, especially in a rude age,
would strictly observe so many ceremonies, and be at so great pains
in making a cake, which, when folded together, makes but a scanty
mouthful.<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href=
"#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> Besides, it is always given away in
presents to strangers who frequent the fair. The custom seems to
have been originally derived from paganism, and to contain not a
few of the sacred rites peculiar to that impure religion; as the
leavened dough, and the mixing it with sugar and spices, the
consecrated ground, &amp;c.; but the particular deity, for whose
honour these cakes were at first made, is not, perhaps, easy to
determine. Probably it was no other than the one known in Scripture
(Jer. 7 ch. 18 v.) by the name of the Queen of Heaven, and to whom
cakes were likewise kneaded by women.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF PETER'S PENCE.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>The custom of paying "Peter's pence" is of Saxon origin; and
they continued to be paid by the inhabitants of England, till the
abolition of the Papal power. The event by which their payment was
enacted is as follows:&mdash;Ethelbert, king of the east angles,
having reigned single some time, thought fit to take a wife; for
this purpose he came to the court of Offa, king of Mercia, to
desire his daughter in marriage. Queenrid, consort of Offa, a
cruel, ambitious, and blood-thirsty woman, who envied the retinue
and splendour of the unsuspicious king, resolved in some manner to
have him murdered, before he left their court, hoping by that to
gain his immense riches; for this purpose she, with her malicious
and fascinating arts, overcame the king&mdash;her husband, which
she most cunningly effected, and, under deep disguises, laid open
to him her portentous design; a villain was therefore hired, named
Gimberd, who was to murder the innocent prince. The manner in which
the heinous crime was effected was as cowardly as it was fatal:
under the chair of state in which Ethelbert sat, a deep pit was
dug; at the bottom of it was placed the murderer; the unfortunate
king was then let through a trap-door into the pit; his fear
overcame him so much, that he did not attempt resistance. Three
months after this, Queenrid died, when circumstances convinced Offa
of the innocence of Ethelbert; he therefore, to appease his guilt,
built St. Alban's monastery, gave one-tenth part of his goods to
the poor, and went in penance to Rome&mdash;where <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> he
gave to the Pope a penny for every house in his dominions, which
were afterwards called <i>Rome shot</i>, or <i>Peter's pence</i>,
and given by the inhabitants of England, &amp;c. till 1533, when
Henry VIII. shook off the authority of the Pope in this
country.</p>

<h2>ARCANA OF SCIENCE.</h2>
<hr />
<h3><i>Black and White Swans.</i></h3>
<p>A few weeks since a <i>black swan</i> was killed by his white
companions, in the neighbourhood of London. Of this extraordinary
circumstance, an eye-witness gives the following
account:&mdash;</p>
<p>I was walking, between four and five o'clock on Saturday
afternoon, in the Regent's Park, when my attention was attracted by
an unusual noise on the water, which I soon ascertained to arise
from a furious attack made by two white swans on the solitary black
one. The <i>allied</i> couple pursued with the greatest ferocity
the unfortunate <i>rara avis</i>, and one of them succeeded in
getting the neck of his enemy between his bill, and shaking it
violently. The poor black with difficulty extricated himself from
this murderous grasp, hurried on shore, tottered a few paces from
the water's edge, and fell. His death appeared to be attended with
great agony, stretching his neck in the air, fluttering his wings,
and attempting to rise from the ground. At length, after about five
minutes of suffering, he made a last effort to rise, and fell with
outstretched neck and wings. One of the keepers came up at the
moment, and found the poor bird dead. It is remarkable, that his
foes never left the water in pursuit, but continued sailing up and
down to the spot wherein their victim fell, with every feather on
end, and apparently proud of their conquest.</p>
<h3><i>Fascination of Snakes.</i></h3>
<p>I have often heard stories about the power that snakes have to
charm birds and animals, which, to say the least, I always treated
with the coldness of scepticism, nor could I believe them until
convinced by ocular demonstration. A case occurred in
Williamsburgh, Massachussets, one mile south of the house of public
worship, by the way-side, in July last. As I was walking in the
road at noon-day, my attention was drawn to the fence by the
fluttering and hopping of a robin red-breast, and a cat-bird,
which, upon my approach, flew up, and perched on a sapling two or
three rods distant; at this instant a large black snake reared his
head from the ground near the fence. I immediately stepped back a
little, and sat down upon an eminence; the snake in a few moments
slunk again to the earth, with a calm, placid appearance; and the
birds soon after returned, and lighted upon the ground near the
snake, first stretching their wings upon the ground, and spreading
their tails, they commenced fluttering round the snake, drawing
nearer at almost every step, until they stepped near or across the
snake, which would often move a little, or throw himself into a
different posture, apparently to seize his prey; which movements, I
noticed, seemed to frighten the birds, and they would veer off a
few feet, but return again as soon as the snake was motionless. All
that was wanting for the snake to secure the victims seemed to be,
that the birds should pass near his head, which they would probably
have soon done, but at this moment a wagon drove up and stopped.
This frightened the snake, and it crawled across the fence into the
grass: notwithstanding, the birds flew over the fence into the
grass also, and appeared to be bewitched, to flutter around their
charmer, and it was not until an attempt was made to kill the snake
that the birds would avail themselves of their wings, and fly into
a forest one hundred rods distant. The movements of the birds while
around the snake seemed to be voluntary, and without the least
constraint; nor did they utter any distressing cries, or appear
enraged, as I have often seen them when squirrels, hawks, and
mischievous boys attempted to rob their nests, or catch their young
ones; but they seemed to be drawn by some allurement or enticement,
and not by any constraining or provoking power; indeed, I
thoroughly searched all the fences and trees in the vicinity, to
find some nest or young birds, but could find none. What this
fascinating power is, whether it be the look or effluvium, or the
singing by the vibration of the tail of the snake, or anything
else, I will not attempt to determine&mdash;possibly this power may
be owing to different causes in different kinds of snakes. But so
far as the black snake is concerned, <i>it seems to be nothing more
than an enticement or allurement with which the snake is endowed to
procure his fowl</i>.&mdash;<i>Professor Silliman's
Journal</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Boring Marine Animals.</i></h3>
<p>The most destructive of these is the <i>Teredo Navalis</i>, a
fine specimen of which was exhibited at a recent meeting of the
Portsmouth Philosophical Society. This animal has been said to
extend the whole length of the boring tube; but this assertion is
erroneous, since the tubes are formed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span> by a
secretion from the body of the animal, and are often many feet in
length, and circuitous in their course. This was shown to be the
fact, by a large piece of wood pierced in all directions. The
manner in which it affects its passage, and the interior of the
tubes, were also described. The assertion that the <i>Teredo</i>
does not attack teak timber was disproved; and its destructive
ravages on the bottom of ships exemplified, by a relation of the
providential escape of his majesty's ship Sceptre, which having
lost some copper from off her bows, the timbers were pierced
through to such an extent as to render her incapable of pursuing
her voyage without repair.</p>
<h3><i>Anthracite, or Stone Coal.</i></h3>
<p>Professor Silliman's last journal contains a very important
article, illustrative of the practical application of this mineral;
and the vast quantities of it that may be found in Great Britain
renders the information highly valuable to our manufacturing
interests. In no part of the world is anthracite, so valuable in
the arts and for economical purposes, found so abundantly as in
Pennsylvania. For the manufacture of iron this fuel is peculiarly
advantageous, as it embraces little sulphur or other injurious
ingredients; produces an intense steady heat; and, for most
operations, it is equal, if not superior to coke. Bar iron,
anchors, chains, steamboat machinery, and wrought-iron of every
description, has more tenacity and malleability, with less waste of
metal, when fabricated by anthracite, than by the aid of bituminous
coal or charcoal, with a diminution of fifty per cent. in the
expense of labour and fuel. For breweries, distilleries, and the
raising of steam, anthracite coal is decidedly preferable to other
fuel, the heat being more steady and manageable, and the boilers
less corroded by sulphureous acid, while no bad effects are
produced by smoke and bitumen. The anthracite of Pennsylvania is
located between the Blue Bridge and Susquehannah; and has not
hitherto been found in other parts of the state, except in the
valley of Wyoming.</p>
<h3><i>Holly Hedges.</i></h3>
<p>At Tynningham, the residence of the Earl of Harrington, are
holly hedges extending 2,952 yards, in some cases 13 feet broad and
25 feet high. The age of these hedges is something more than a
century. At the same place are individual trees of a size quite
unknown in these southern districts. One tree measures 5 feet 3 in.
in circumference at 3 feet from the ground; the stem is clear of
branches to the height of 14 feet, and the total height of the tree
is 54 feet. At Colinton House, the seat of Sir David Forbes;
Hopetown House, and Gordon Castle are also several large groups of
hollies, apparently planted by the hand of Nature.&mdash;<i>Trans.
Horticultural Society</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Egg Plants.</i></h3>
<p>In this country, the egg plant, brinjal, or aubergine, is
chiefly cultivated as a curiosity; but in warmer climates, where
its growth is attended with less trouble, it is a favourite article
of the kitchen garden. In the form of fritters, or farces, or in
soups, it is frequently brought to table in all the southern parts
of Europe, and forms a pleasant variety of
esculent.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
<h3><i>Vinegar made from Black Ants.</i></h3>
<p>It is singular enough, that a discovery of modern chemistry
should long have been practically employed in some parts of Norway,
for the purpose of making vinegar from a large species of black
ant. The method employed in Norlanden is simply this: they first
collect a sufficient quantity of these little animals, by plunging
a bottle partly filled with water up to the neck in one of the
large ant-hills; into which they naturally creep, and are drowned.
The contents are then boiled together, and the acid thus produced
is made use of by the inhabitants as <i>vinegar</i>, being strong
and good.</p>
<h3><i>Soil for Fruit Trees.</i></h3>
<p>Low grounds that form the banks of rivers are, of all others,
the best adapted for the growth of fruit trees; the alluvial soil
of which they are composed, being an intermixture of the richest
and most soluble parts of the neighbouring lands, with a portion of
animal and vegetable matter, affording an inexhaustible store of
nourishment&mdash;<i>Trans. Horticultural Society</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Watch Alarum.</i></h3>
<p>A patent has recently been procured for a most useful appendage
to a watch, for giving alarm at any hour during the night. Instead
of encumbering a watch designed to be worn in the pocket with the
striking apparatus, (by which it would be increased to double the
ordinary thickness), this ingenious invention has the alarum or
striking part detached, and forming a bed on which the watch is to
be laid; a communication being made by a lever, projecting through
the watch case, to connect the works. This appendage is described
to be applicable to any watch of the usual construction, and is by
no means expensive.</p>

<h3>NOVEMBER.</h3>
<p>November is associated with gloom, inasmuch as its days and
nights are, for the most part, sullen and sad. But the transition
to this gloom is slow, gradual, and almost imperceptible. The
mornings of the month are generally foggy, and are thus described
by a modern poet:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Not pleasureless the morn, when dismal fog</p>
<p>Rolls o'er the dewy plain, or thin mist drives;</p>
<p>When the lone timber's saturated branch</p>
<p>Drips freely."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the progress of day,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Shorn of his glory through the dim profound,</p>
<p>With melancholy aspect looks the orb</p>
<p>Of stifled day, and while he strives to pierce</p>
<p>And dissipate the slow reluctant gloom,</p>
<p>Seems but a rayless globe, an autumn moon,</p>
<p>That gilds opaque the purple zone of eve,</p>
<p>And yet distributes of her thrifty beam.</p>
<p>Lo! now he conquers; now, subdued awhile,</p>
<p>Awhile subduing, the departed mist</p>
<p>Yields in a brighter beam, or darker clouds</p>
<p>His crimson disk obscure."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The country has now exchanged its refreshing varieties of greens
for the hues of saffron, russet, and dark brown. "The trees," says
an amusing observer of nature, "generally lose their leaves in the
following succession:&mdash;walnut, mulberry, horse-chestnut,
sycamore, lime, ash, then, after an interval, elm:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;&mdash;'To him who walks</p>
<p>Now in the sheltered mead, loud roars above,</p>
<p>Among the naked branches of the elm,</p>
<p>Still freshening as the hurried cloud departs,</p>
<p>The strong Atlantic gale.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Then beech and oak, then apple and peach trees, sometimes not
till the end of November; and lastly, pollard-oaks and young
beeches, which retain their withered leaves till pushed off by the
new ones in spring."</p>
<p>The rural economy of the month is thus described by the same
writer:&mdash;"The farmer endeavours to finish his ploughing this
month, and then lays up his instruments for the spring. Cattle are
kept in the yard or stable, sheep turned into the turnip-field, or
in bad weather fed with hay, bees moved under shelter, and pigeons
fed in the dove-house."</p>
<p>The gardens, for the most part, begin to show the wear of
desolation, and but little of their floral pride remains without
doors. Meanwhile, a mimic garden is displayed within, and the
hyacinth, narcissus, &amp;c. are assembled there to gladden us with
anticipations of the coming spring.</p>
<p>Though sombre and drear, a November day is a <i>carnival</i> for
the reflective observer; the very falling of the leaves,
intercepted in their descent by a little whirl or hurricane, is to
him a feast of meditation, and "the soul, dissolving, as it were,
into a spirit of melancholy enthusiasm, acknowledges that silent
pathos, which governs without subduing the heart."&mdash;"This
season, so sacred to the enthusiast, has been, in all ages,
selected by the poet and the moralist, as a theme for poetic
description and moral reflection;" and we may add that amidst such
scenes, Newton drew the most glorious problem of his philosophy,
and Bishop Horne his simple but pathetic lines on the "Fall of the
Leaf,"&mdash;lessons of nature which will still find their way to
the hearts of mankind, when the more subtle workings of speculative
philosophy shall be forgotten with their promoters.</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<h3>THE ROBBER SPATOLINO.</h3>
<p>The history of Spatolino exhibits rather the character of a man
bred where men are in a state of nature, than of one born in the
midst of an old European state. This extraordinary character,
furiously irritated against the French, who had invaded Italy,
desperately bent himself upon revenge, and directed his attacks
unceasingly upon their battalions. He might perhaps have become a
great general, had he entered the military profession: had he
received a competent education, he might have been a virtuous and
eminent citizen. His first crime was an act of vengeance, and all
his following delinquencies flowed from the same source. An
enthusiastic feeling placed the blade in his hand against the
invaders of the Roman States, and a superior sagacity aided his
terrible energies. He died stigmatised with the titles of brigand
and assassin; but the French, on whom he had exercised the most
striking acts of revenge, were his judges, his accusers, and
executioners. In all his acts the man of courage could be
distinguished, finding resources, in whatever dangers, in his own
genius. He never was a traitor himself, although often betrayed by
his most intimate friends. His vindictive exploits were prompt and
terrible. The French greatly dreaded him. His life presents traits
truly romantic; sometimes they may appear exaggerated; but his
history is from an authentic source, and from his voluntary
confession.</p>
<p>The reader may wish to know something of the person of
Spatolino. He was of low stature, long visage, fair skin, but his
face of an olive pale hue; his eyes of a light blue, and full of
animation; his aspect fierce; hair light; long whiskers; lips pale;
broad back; swift of foot; and particularly animated in his action.
He wore a jerkin lined with red, a dark yellow waistcoat, blue
breeches, a breast-pouch with fifty cartridges, four pistols, and a
small hanger by his side. In his breeches-pocket he kept a small
stiletto. He also bore a long gun. On his head he wore continually
a net, and upon that his hat. His wife followed him in all his
excursions, and he greatly esteemed and loved her. He remained some
time in the mountains near Rome, and with his associates laid in a
store of whatever was necessary for their new avocation. He then
resolved upon proceeding to Sonnino, the common rendezvous of the
greater part of the banditti in the papal states. In Sonnino he
found some followers, who, going deeply into his notions, did not
scruple to join him. They swore to entertain an eternal friendship
for each other, implacable hatred against the French, and laid it
down as a duty to rob and kill them. Spatolino, before commencing
his career as brigand, repaired to the curate of Sonnino, and
requested absolution for all the crimes he had or might commit; the
curate, surprised at this request, observed to him, that absolution
was only given after sins were committed. Spatolino very soon
quieted the scruples of the curate, by making him a present of a
very handsome watch; upon which he immediately raised his hands and
gave him the desired absolution. Sonnino may be compared with
Pontus, where Ovid was in exile, and which is thus described by
that celebrated author:&mdash;"The men I meet with are not even
worthy of the name; they are more fierce than wolves; have no laws,
as with them armed force constitutes justice, and injury rights.
They live by rapine, but seek it not without peril, and sword in
hand. Every other way of purveying for their necessities they view
as base and ignominious. It is enough for them to be seen to be
hated and dreaded. The sound of their voice is ferocious; their
physiognomy horrible, and their complexion cadaverous." Just such
are the inhabitants of Sonnino and its vicinity at present, and
among such Spatolino came to complete his band, which, when formed
in Rome, consisted of seven only.</p>
<p>Before proceeding on his expedition, and to attach his wife more
closely to his person by proving his strong affection, he left his
band and proceeded to Civita Vecchia, and seeking a sailor who had
seduced her, he expressed a wish to speak with him a little
distance from the town. The sailor, conceiving it might be
something to his advantage, followed immediately. Spatolino
conducted him a little beyond the gate of Civita Vecchia, and
giving him two thrusts of his stiletto in his heart, cut off his
ears and nose, to carry them as a present to his wife, and then
departed immediately for Sonnino. On his arrival, he proceeded to
seek Mary and his band. After the usual salutations, he took out of
his pocket the small bundle containing the nose and ears of the
sailor, and, presenting them to his wife, said, "From this you may
judge my affection. I was desirous of avenging your wrongs, and
have done so by killing your seducer. Here are the pledges of it,
which you should keep, in order to remind you of the betrayer, and
as a guard <span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id=
"page322"></a>[pg 322]</span> against future temptation. You cannot
mistrust me, when I promise ever to afford you proofs of true
attachment, and I hope you will be faithful to me!" After this they
embraced affectionately, and swore to each other eternal fidelity.
Nor is it possible for any man to have kept his word more
scrupulously towards his wife. The following day Spatolino departed
at the head of his band, which was composed of eighteen persons,
himself and wife included, and proceeded to the vicinity of
Portatta, near the main road leading from Rome to Naples, which at
that time was much frequented by the French of every rank and
condition, who proceeded under orders between these two places.
Towards night, Spatolino placed himself and comrades in ambush on
the high road, intending to take advantage of a military body of
which he had information. Ere long a sound of horses was heard;
they were immediately on the alert, and succeeded in arresting a
French escort of seven soldiers on foot, and the same number on
horseback, conducting the baggage-wagon of a French colonel of the
line. It contained all his effects, and money to a large amount.
Upon the first fire of Spatolino's band, five of the soldiers were
killed, and three desperately wounded; he then threw himself
amongst the others, who were placed on the defence, and who had
expended their fire without hurting a single individual of the
band. Spatolino, with his pistols, killed two, and a few moments
saw him and his band masters of the field. Spatolino ordered his
men to strip the dead, and placing every thing in the wagon, after
digging a pit for the bodies, they retired to a cave in a wood near
the road, where the booty was equally divided. He took himself two
of the best horses, and armed and equipped his band in a superior
manner. He also presented to his wife a part of the spoil, she
having been armed in the action, performing the duty of a sentinel
on the highway in advance about half a mile off, to give notice, in
case of an overwhelming force appearing. Spatolino, having made a
fair division of the spoil to raise the courage of his companions,
sent all his own money to his parents, informing them at the same
time, that for the future they should be released from misery, as
he would ever bear in mind the beings who gave him
birth.&mdash;<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>.</p>

<h3>LONDON NEWSPAPERS.</h3>
<p>On few subjects are the public under more misapprehension than
on the absolute and relative circulation of several portions of the
London daily press. The greater part of the people would startle
were they told that The Times circulates probably under 7,000 a day
on an average; the paper is seen, as one may say, in every
pot-house in London, and all over the country; and yet this is all
its number.</p>
<p>The property of a paper is a matter of which most people have a
very vague and imperfect knowledge. I believe I am very near the
truth when I state the gross proceeds of The Times at
45,000<i>l.</i>, a year. The present proprietor of The Morning
Chronicle gave for it, I believe, 40,000<i>l.</i> The absolute
property of The Courier, according to the current rate of its
shares, is between 90,000<i>l.</i> and 100,000<i>l.</i> Estimating
the value of The Globe on the same scale, the absolute property of
it is probably somewhere about 35,000<i>l.</i> The profits of a
paper arise almost entirely out of its advertisements, and hence
the difference in value between the two last, notwithstanding their
circulation is so nearly equal. A newspaper gets its advertisements
by degrees, and, as it is supposed by the public, its numbers
increase; but it retains them long after the cause by which they
were acquired has vanished. It is thus that The Courier, which got
its advertisements when it basked in all the sunshine of
ministerial patronage, retains these when its numbers are reduced
by one-half, and the countenance of government is no longer held
out to it.</p>
<p>These, however, it must be admitted, are the prizes in the
lottery of newspaper speculation: and in this, as in every other
lottery, there are more blanks than prizes. Mr. Murray, after
having expended upwards of 10,000<i>l.</i> on his Representative,
sold it to the proprietors of The New Times for about 600<i>l.</i>:
and The British Press, after having ruined I know not how many
capitalists, was sold to the <span class="pagenum"><a name=

believe, a considerably smaller sum.&mdash;<i>London

<h3>MADEMOISELLE CUVIER.</h3>
<p>Mademoiselle Cuvier, daughter of the celebrated naturalist, died
a short time since at Paris. There has seldom been any instance
where the strongest benevolence was so closely united to the charms
of intellect. She possessed a rare mixture of elevation of mind and
firmness of character&mdash;of strength and
equanimity&mdash;sweetness and simplicity. It was truly gratifying
to witness her worship, or rather superstition, for truth, and to
watch the avidity with which she used to seize and illustrate
whatever she thought likely to remove ignorance, or promote the
cause of virtue and freedom. The circumstances which attended the
death of this amiable creature, have, if possible, greatly
augmented the grief of her family and friends. The day of her
nuptials was fixed, and she was to be united to a man of her own
choice, and everything was prepared for the ceremony. Being
suddenly afflicted by rapid symptoms of consumption, all hopes of
her recovery soon vanished. Notwithstanding, the ball dresses,
veils, and shawls, continued to be sent home to the unhappy
parents, who dared not refuse them, lest they should themselves be
accused of giving way to despair. This mixture of preparations for
rejoicing, and the certainty of death, formed a picture the most
melancholy and pathetic. When the fatal moment arrived, her family
and many friends surrounded the dying couch in mournful silence.
The funeral was attended by all that is distinguished for rank and
fortune at Paris; a clergyman of the Protestant church read the
service for the dead, and a funeral sermon. A number of young
females whom she had formed for succouring the poor, were ranged
round the bier, dressed in white, and followed to the Cemetery of
P&egrave;re la Chaise, where M. Salvandy, one of her friends,
undertook to deliver the final eulogy, which it is usual in France
to pronounce on departed worth.&mdash;<i>Monthly

rung&mdash;now grimly gazing on a bit of bloody beef which your
impatience has forced the blaspheming cook to draw from the spit
ere the outer folds of fat were well melted at the fire&mdash;now,
after a disappointed dinner, discovering that the old port is
corked, and the filberts all pluffing with bitter snuff, except
such as enclose a worm&mdash;now an unwholesome sleep of
interrupted snores, your bobbing head ever and anon smiting your

<h3>SLEEPING AFTER DINNER.</h3>
<p>Mr. Fox at St. Ann's Hill was, for the last years of his life,
in the habit (never interfered with by his friends) of dosing for a
few minutes after dinner; and it was on this occasion,

Mr. Garrow, who was the chief talker (Parr was in his smoking

I, therefore, made signs to Mr. Fox, by wiping my fingers to my

<h3>CHRONICLES OF THE CANONGATE.</h3>
<p><i>The Two Drovers.</i></p>
<p>(<i>Concluded from page 289.</i>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Our readers must have missed, and probably with some regret,
the conclusion of the above story, as promised for insertion in our
last Number; and unaccustomed as we are to an intentional
discrepancy of this sort, (for such was the above,) we shall
consider ourselves justified in briefly stating some of the
circumstances which led to the irregularity. We are not disposed to
enter into the tilts of rival journalists, some of whom, in taking
time by the forelock, may have perhaps been rather more
enterprising than the subject warranted.<a id="footnotetag17" name=
"footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
Nevertheless, in the attempt to please the public, as in other
races, the youngest are often the fleetest. In the present case,
the appetite of the public had been <i>whetted</i> with "reiterated
advertisement:" and one of our contemporaries, with more
playfulness than truth, had compared his priority to that of
<i>Fine-ear</i> in the fairy tale. But his talisman failed, and a
young rival outstripped him; and from this quarter we were induced
to copy the first portion of the tale of <i>The Two Drovers</i>,
upon the editor's assurance of his own honesty in obtaining the
precedence, and which assurance We are still unwilling to question:
although, were we to do so, ours would not he a solitary specimen
of such ingratitude.<a id="footnotetag18" name=
"footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> On the
day of our publishing the first portion, we received a notice to
desist from its continuance,&mdash;full of the causticity of our
friends on the other side of the Tweed, and with whom, for the
credit of the south, we hope the measure originated. We next
resolved to suspend the conclusion; since the <i>brutum fulmen</i>
became louder and louder still, in an advertisement actively
inserted in the London newspapers. To make short of what is and
ought to be but a trifling affair, we have <i>abridged</i> the
whole story, and accordingly now present the conclusion to our
readers, though certainly not in the promised state; how far we
have exculpated ourselves, is for our patrons to determine.&mdash;A
few words at parting, on the policy of the above conduct. We need
not enlarge upon the advantages which publishers (and, to some
extent, authors) derive from portions of their works appearing in
periodical journals. The benefit is not reciprocal, but largely on
their side, if they consider how many columns of advertisement duty
they thereby avoid. It is well known that the <i>first edition</i>
of any work by such a master-spirit as Sir Walter Scott is consumed
in a few days by the circulating libraries and reading societies of
the kingdom; but how many thousands would neither have seen nor
heard of his most successful works, had not the <i>gusto</i> been
previously created by the caducei of these literary Mercuries.
Again, sift any one of them, with higher pretensions to originality
than our economical sheet will admit of, and you shall find it, in
<i>quantity</i>, at least, to resemble Gratiano's three grains. But
we are not inclined to quarrel with the scheme, for with Johnson we
say, "Quotation, sir (Walter), is a good thing," in the hope of
hearing our readers reply, "This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons
peas."&mdash;ED.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some words passed after the departure, of Robin Oig, between the
bailiff, and Harry Wakefield, who was now not indisposed to defend
Robin Oig's reputation. But Dame Heskett prevented this second
quarrel by her peremptory interference. The conversation turned on
the expected markets, and the prices from different parts of
Scotland and England, and Harry Wakefield found a chap for a part
of his drove, and at a considerable profit; an event more than
sufficient to blot out all remembrances of the past scuffle. But
there remained one from whose mind that recollection could not have
been wiped by possession of every head of cattle betwixt Esk and
Eden.</p>
<p>This was Robin Oig M'Combich.&mdash;"That I should have had no
weapon," he said, "and for the first time in my
life!&mdash;Blighted be the tongue that bids the Highlander part
with the dirk&mdash;the dirk&mdash;ha! the English blood!&mdash;My
muhme's word&mdash;when did her word fall to the ground?"</p>
<p>Robin now turned the light foot of his country towards the
wilds, through which, by Mr. Ireby's report, Morrison was
advancing. His mind was wholly engrossed by the sense of injury the
treasured ideas of self-importance and self-opinion&mdash;of ideal
birth and quality, had become more precious to him, (like the hoard
to the miser,) because he could only enjoy them in secret. But
insulted, abused, and beaten, he was no longer worthy, in his own
opinion, of the name he bore, or the lineage which he belonged
to&mdash;nothing was left to him&mdash;but revenge.</p>
<p>When Robin Oig left the door of the ale-house, seven or eight
English miles <span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id=
"page325"></a>[pg 325]</span> at least lay betwixt him and
Morrison, whose advance was limited by the sluggish pace of his
cattle. And now the distant lowing of Morrison's cattle is heard;
and now he meets them&mdash;passes them, and stops their
conductor.</p>
<p>"May good betide us," said the South-lander&mdash;"Is this you,
Robin M'Combich, or your wraith?"</p>
<p>"It is Robin Oig M'Combich," answered the Highlander, "and it is
not.&mdash;But never mind that, give me pack my dirk, Hugh
Morrison, or there will be words petween us."</p>
<p>"There it is for you then, since less wunna serve."</p>
<p>"Cot speed you, Hughie, and send you good marcats. Ye winna meet
with Robin Oig again either at tryste or fair."</p>
<p>So saying, he shook hastily the hand of his acquaintance, and
set out in the direction from which he had advanced.</p>
<p>Long ere the morning dawned, the catastrophe of our tale had
taken place. It was two hours after the affray when Robin Oig
returned to Heskett's inn. There was Harry Wakefield, who amidst a
grinning group of smockfrocks, hob-nailed shoes, and jolly English
physiognomies, was trolling forth an old ditty, when he was
interrupted by a high and stern voice, saying "Harry
Waakfelt&mdash;if you be a man, stand up!"</p>
<p>"Harry Waakfelt," repeated the same ominous summons, "stand up,
if you be a man!"</p>
<p>"I will stand up with all my heart, Robin, my boy, but it shall
be to shake hands with you, and drink down all unkindness.</p>
<p>"'Tis not thy fault, man, that, not having the luck to be an
Englishman, thou canst not fight more than a school-girl."</p>
<p>"I <i>can</i> fight," answered Robin Oig, sternly, but calmly,
"and you shall know it. You, Harry Waakfelt, showed me to-day how
the Saxon churls fight&mdash;I show you now how the Highland
Dunniewassal fights."</p>
<p>He then plunged the dagger, which he suddenly displayed, into
the broad breast of the English yeoman, with such fatal certainty
and force, that the hilt made a hollow sound against the breast
bone, and the double-edged point split the very heart of his
victim. Harry Wakefield fell, and expired with a single groan.</p>
<p>Robin next offered the bloody poniard to the bailiff's
throat.</p>
<p>"It were very just to lay you beside him," he said, "but the
blood of a base pick-thank shall never mix on my father's dirk,
with that of a brave man."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he threw the fatal weapon into the blazing
turf-fire.</p>
<p>"There," he said, "take me who likes&mdash;and let fire cleanse
blood if it can."</p>
<p>The pause still continuing, Robin Oig asked for a peace-officer,
and a constable having stepped out, he surrendered himself.</p>
<p>"A bloody night's work you have made of it," said the
constable.</p>
<p>"Your own fault," said the Highlander. "Had you kept his hands
off me twa hours since, he would have been now as well and merry as
he was twa minutes since."</p>
<p>"It must be sorely answered," said the peace-officer.</p>
<p>"Never you mind that&mdash;death pays all debts; it will pay
that too."</p>
<p>The constable, with assistance, procured horses to guard the
prisoner to Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next assizes. While
the escort was preparing, the prisoner, before he was carried from
the fatal apartment, desired to look at the dead body, which had
been deposited upon the large table, (at the head of which Harry
Wakefield had just presided) until the surgeons should examine the
wound. The face of the corpse was decently covered with a napkin.
Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed on the lifeless visage.
While those present expected that the wound, which had so lately
flooded the apartment with gore, would send forth fresh streams at
the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the covering, with
the brief exclamation, "He was a pretty man!"</p>
<p>My story is nearly ended. The unfortunate Highlander stood his
trial at Carlisle. I was myself present. The facts of the case were
proved in the manner I have related them; and whatever might be at
first the prejudice of the audience against a crime so un-English
as that of assassination from revenge, yet when the national
prejudices of the prisoner had been explained, which made him
consider himself as stained with indelible dishonour, the
generosity of the English audience was inclined to regard his crime
as the aberration of a false idea of honour, rather than as flowing
from a heart naturally savage, or habitually vicious. I shall never
forget the charge of the venerable judge to the jury.</p>
<p>"We have had," he said, "in the previous part of our duty,
(alluding to some former trials,) to discuss crimes which infer
disgust and abhorrence, while they call down the well-merited
vengeance of the law. It is now our still more melancholy duty to
apply its salutary, though severe enactments to a case of a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg
326]</span> singular character, in which the crime (for a crime it
is, and a deep one) arose less out of the malevolence of the heart,
than the error of the understanding&mdash;less from any idea of
committing wrong, than from an unhappily perverted notion of that
which is right. Here we have two men, highly esteemed, it has been
stated, in their rank of life, and attached, it seems, to each
other as friends, one of whose lives has been already sacrificed to
a punctilio, and the other is about to prove the vengeance of the
offended laws; and yet both may claim our commiseration at least,
as men acting in ignorance of each other's national prejudices, and
unhappily misguided rather than voluntarily erring from the path of
right conduct.</p>
<p>In the original cause of the misunderstanding, we must in
justice give the right to the prisoner at the bar. He had acquired
possession of the enclosure, by a legal contract with the
proprietor, and yet, when accosted with galling reproaches he
offered to yield up half his acquisition, and his amicable proposal
was rejected with scorn. Then follows the scene at Mr. Heskett the
publican's, and you will observe how the stranger was treated by
the deceased, and I am sorry to observe, by those around, who seem
to have urged him in a manner which was aggravating in the highest
degree.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, it was with some impatience that I heard
my learned brother, who opened the case for the crown, give an
unfavourable turn to the prisoner's conduct on this occasion. He
said the prisoner was afraid to encounter his antagonist in fair
fight, or to submit to the laws of the ring; and that therefore,
like a cowardly Italian, he had recourse to his fatal stiletto, to
murder the man whom he dared not meet in manly encounter. I
observed the prisoner shrink from this part of the accusation with
the abhorrence natural to a brave man; and as I would wish to make
my words impressive, when I point his real crime, I must secure his
opinion of my impartiality, by rebutting every thing that seems to
me a false accusation. There can be no doubt that the prisoner is a
man of resolution&mdash;too much resolution; I wish to heaven that
he had less, or rather that he had had a better education to
regulate it.</p>
<hr />
<p>"But, gentlemen of the jury, the pinch of the case lies in the
interval of two hours betwixt the injury and the fatal retaliation.
In the heat of affray and <i>chaude mel&eacute;e</i>, law,
compassionating the infirmities of humanity, makes allowance for
the passions which rule such a stormy moment&mdash;But the time
necessary to walk twelve miles, however speedily performed, was an
interval sufficient for the prisoner to have recollected himself;
and the violence and deliberate determination with which he carried
his purpose into effect, could neither be induced by anger, nor
fear. It was the purpose and the act of pre-determined revenge, for
which law neither can, will, nor ought to have sympathy.</p>
<hr />
<p>The law says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior to that
of the Deity, 'Vengeance is mine.' The instant that there is time
for passion to cool, and reason to interpose, an injured party must
become aware, that the law assumes the exclusive cognizance of the
right and wrong betwixt the parties, and opposes her inviolable
buckler to every attempt of the private party to right himself. I
repeat, that this unhappy man ought personally to be the object
rather of our pity than our abhorrence, for he failed in his
ignorance, and from mistaken notions of honour. But his crime is
not the less that of murder, gentlemen, and, in your high and
important office, it is your duty so to find. Englishmen have their
angry passions as well as Scots; and should this man's action
remain unpunished, you may unsheath, under various pretences, a
thousand daggers betwixt the Land's-end and the Orkneys."</p>
<p>The venerable judge thus ended what, to judge by his emotion and
tears, was really a painful task. The jury, accordingly brought in
a verdict of guilty; and Robin Oig M'Combich, <i>alias</i>
M'Gregor, was sentenced to death, and executed accordingly. He met
his fate with firmness, and acknowledged the justice of his
sentence. But he repelled indignantly the observations of those who
accused him of attacking an unarmed man. "I give a life for the
life I took," he said, "and what can I do more?"</p>

<h3>A CURIOUS FACT.</h3>
<p>An absent man, whose heart can seldom resist the importunities
of beggars, was, a few mornings since, followed by a hungry
half-starved dog, when he inadvertently took from his pocket a
penny, which he was just about to give to the four-footed wanderer,
when he perceived his mistake. It should be mentioned that the
above individual had, on nearly the precise spot, on the previous
night, assisted one of his fellow creatures in the same manner as
that in which he was about to relieve the quadruped. The EDITOR of
the MIRROR will be happy to substantiate this fact to such as may
be disposed to doubt its authenticity:&mdash;"if it be madness,
there's method in it."</p>

<p>Crime is a curse only to the period in which it is successful;
but virtue, whether fortunate or otherwise, blesses not only its
own age, but remotest posterity, and is as beneficial by its
example, as by its immediate effects.</p>
<p>At the late Doncaster races, there were 30,000 persons well

<p>Singing <i>Non Nobis Domine</i> after dinner is a very foolish
custom. People in England pay 10,000<i>l.</i> a year for <i>non
nobis</i>. Rather sing Dr. Kitchener's Universal Prayer and the
English grace. The common people of every country understand only
their native tongue; therefore if you do not understand them, you
will not understand each other. All Italian music is detestable,
and nothing like our genuine native song. Weber's "unconcatenated
chords" ought not to be listened to, while we have such composers
as Braham and Tom Cooke. The <i>national songs of Great Britain</i>
have not sold so well as the <i>Cook's Oracle</i>. "People like
what goes into the mouth better than what comes out of
it."&mdash;<i>Dr. Kitchener</i>.</p>

<p>According to the Report of the Commissioners of Public
Charities, the <i>annual</i> sum of 972,396<i>l.</i> has been

<p>M. La Combe, in his <i>Picture of London</i>, advises those who

robbers.</p>
<p>The silly habit of praising every thing at a man's table came in
for a share of the late Dr. Kitchener's severity. He said,
"Criticism, sir, is not a pastime; it is a verdict on oath: the man
who does it is (morally) sworn to perform his duty. There is but
one character on earth, sir," he would add, "that I detest; and
that is the man who praises, indiscriminately, every dish that is
set before him. Once I find a fellow do that at my table, and, if
he were my brother, I never ask him to dinner again."</p>

<h3>OLD GRIMALDI.</h3>
<p>The first Grimaldi celebrated on the stage, appeared at Paris
about the year 1735, when his athletic force and extraordinary
agility procured him the sobriquet of "Jambe de Fer," or iron-leg.
In 1742, when Mahomet Effendi, ambassador of the Porte, visited
Paris, he was received with the highest honour and utmost
distinction; and the court having ordered a performance for the
Turk's entertainment, Grimaldi was commanded to exert himself to
effect that object. In obedience to his directions, in making a
surprising leap, his foot actually struck a lustre, placed high
from the stage, and one of the glass drops was thrown in the face
of the ambassador. It was then customary to demand some reward from
the personage for whom the entertainment was prepared, and, at the
conclusion of the piece, Grimaldi waited upon the Mussulman for the
usual present. If the Turk had concealed the expression of his
anger at the accident, it was not however extinct, for on the
appearance of the buffoon, he directed him to be seized by his
attendants, and transported in his theatrical costume, to his
residence, where, after undergoing a severe bastinado, the hapless
actor was thrust into the street, with only his pedal honour for
his recompense.</p>

<h3>NEGROES' HEIR LOOM.</h3>
<p>Some years ago, the boiler-men negroes on Huckenfield estate

the question was thus set at rest by an old African:&mdash;"When
God Almighty make de world, him make two men, a nigger and a
buckra; and him give dem two box, and him tell dem for make dem
choice. Nigger, (nigger greedy from time,) when him find one box
heavy, him take it, and buckra take t'other; when dem open de box,
buckra see pen, ink, and paper; nigger box full up with hoe and
bill, and hoe and bill for nigger till this
day."&mdash;<i>Barclay's Slavery in the West Indies</i>.</p>

<h3>GRATITUDE.</h3>
<p>When Suffer, who had been fifty years a servant in the English
factory at Abesheber, or Bushire, a Persian sea-port, was on his
death-bed, the English doctor ordered him a glass of wine. He at
first refused, saying, "I cannot take it; it is forbidden in the
Koran." But after a few moments, he begged the doctor to give it
him, saying, as he raised himself in his bed, "Give me the wine;
for it is written in the same volume, that all you unbelievers will
be excluded from Paradise; and the experience of fifty years
teaches me to prefer your society in the other world, to any place
unto which I can be advanced with my own countrymen." He died a few
hours after this sally.&mdash;<i>Sketches of Persia</i>.</p>

<p>We thank our correspondent for the above communication on one of
the most interesting phenomena of British geology; for, as we
hinted in our last, the pleasantest hours of our sojourn at
Margate, about three years since, were passed in the watchmaker's
museum, nearly opposite the Marine Library, which collection
contains many Sheppey fossils, especially a <i>prawn</i>, said to
be the only one in England. We remember the proprietor to have been
a self-educated man: he had been to the museum at Paris twice or
thrice, and spoke in high terms of the courteous reception he met
with from M Cuvier; and we are happy to corroborate his
representations. With respect to the <i>reptile</i>, or, as we
should say, <i>insect</i>, alluded to in the preceding letter, we
suppose it to have been a vermicular insect, similar to those
inhabiting the <i>cells</i> of <i>corallines</i>, of whose tiny
labours, in the formation of coral islands, we quoted a spirited
poetical description in No. 279 of the MIRROR. Corallines much
resemble fossil or petrified wood; and we recollect to have
received from the landlady of an inn at Portsmouth a small branch
of <i>fossil wood</i>, which she asserted to be <i>coral</i>, and
<i>that</i> upon the authority of scores of her visiters; but the
fibres, &amp;c. of the wood were too evident to admit of a
dispute.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
